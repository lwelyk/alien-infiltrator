New Goal;Search Kevo's house;2;;;;
;I should look in the matchbox in the living room on the ground floor. It's next to the tiled stove in the corner. ;;;;;man09c_cl2_lift3
;I can reach the upper floor from the small hallway. Maybe one of the doors there can be opened with the key I found.;;;;;man11
;The yellow porcelain tray in the upper floor bedroom holds something of interest.;;;;;man12d_lift

New Goal;Open the cupboard on the upper floor;3;;;;
;I'd better try the hex key on the dresser in the ground floor bedroom, and see what's in it. ;;;;;man06c_lift2
;I think I can open the corner cupboard in the upper floor bedroom with the code written down in the folder with the will. It's 'BJ61'. If I find something in the cupboard that will get me further, I'll take it.;;;;;man12f_lift2

New Goal;Access the inner room on the upper floor;4;;;;
;I need to explore the area outside the house. I have to follow the path to the left of the house, all the way down to the jetty.;;;;;man22a_lift
;I can use the file on the screwdriver to make it slightly slimmer.;;;;;combo
;I will try the screwdriver on the door on the upper floor now.;;;;;man11c_cl

New Goal;Unlock the diary in the living room;5;;;;
;I must check the room behind the previously locked door on the upper floor thoroughly. The colours on the hanging tapestry might have a meaning. I think they open the diary under the TV in the living room on the ground floor.;;;;;man09c_lift1

New Goal;Open the cigar box;6;;;;
;There's a cigar box in a closet in the room behind the previously locked door on August's upper floor. I think I have enough information on how to open the box in August's letter to his father. The code is probably 'RAZE'. I must take a good look at what's inside the box.;;;;;
